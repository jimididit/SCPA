- A script to autorun after reboot. Run this as root (without `sudo`).

```bash
cat << EOF > /etc/rc.local
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4

exit 0
EOF
```

- Change permission and start the service.

```
$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/rc.local

$ sudo systemctl start rc-local
```
