# Checklist

TODO: Make a cross-reference when making a good checklist for weaponizing when delivering the attack.

## Passive Client Information Gathering

- [ ] Scrape metadata from images and documents. Refer to this [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x04 - Forensics/Checklist|checklist]] to narrow down your search results.
	- [[Exiftool]]
	- [[exifLooter]]
	- [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/F - Post Exploitation/0x02 - Privilege Escalation/Linux/Local Privilege Escalation/Superuser/Sudo/Shell Escape Sequences/Exploits/Network Scanners/Network Mapper|Network Mapper]]
- [ ] Look for job requirements of what technology that the target(s) using that can be weaponized.

## Active Client Information Gathering

- [ ] Interact with the targets through communications to gather information.
	- [ ] Communication via a phone call.
	- [ ] Communication via a person.

## Phishing Campaign

### Pretext

- [ ] For social engineering pretext visit this [[Social Engineering Pretext|section]] to make preparation for the campaign.

### Delivery Method

- [ ] Phishing via Email
	- Gather emails with the following methods.
		- Passively browse the website 
			- [ ] Search for emails to scrape them.
			- [ ] Search for first and last names to parse them to perform user enumeration with the following.
				- SMTP Port
					- [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Network Ports/Cross Platform/Mail Server/SMTP|Username enumeration]]
				- Web mail
		- [ ] OSINT gathering on social media
		- [ ] OSINT gathering using google dorking
			- TODO: Fill in the bullet points/checkboxes
		- [ ] Data breaches
		- [ ] Parse and verify the emails
	- [ ] Check if the domain is spoofable.
- [ ] Phishing via Service
	- Social Media

### Evasion

- [ ] Insert text to bypass **LM (Language Models)** to inject prompt to skip a security scan and change the foreground text color the same as the background document to make it invisible to the user.
- [ ] Insert malicious hyperlinks (any file format will work).
	- [ ] Some webapps have [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Open Redirect/Checklist|Open Redirect]] vulnerabilities. This can be used to insert the malicious URL to redirect the target to the malicious server.
	- [ ] Use **QR Code** with a malicious link to redirect the target to your malicious server.
